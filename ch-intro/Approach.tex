\section{Approach}
\label{sec:introduction:approach}

The approach we follow in this work is one which combines a number of
techniques from the uncertainty quantification, low-dimensional
modeling, and computational modeling communities. The breadth of
techniques employed is needed to address the full scope of the
icing/fire problems.
