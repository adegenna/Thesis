Ensuring the safety of airplane flight is an important and active
arena of research in the aerospace community. Notwithstanding the
research, development, and legislation aimed at certifying airplanes
for safe operation, an analysis of the effects of uncertainties on
certification quantities of interest is generally lacking. The central
objective of this thesis is to examine and analyze problems in
aircraft safety and certification from the standpoint of uncertainty
quantification. In particular, two canonical problems will be
discussed -- the accretion of ice on an airplane airfoil/wing, and the
development of a fire in a cargo hold. This work will discuss the
uncertainties present in each of these scenarios and how they may be
modeled, the output quantities of interest, and how the statistical
relationship between the two may be approximated.
