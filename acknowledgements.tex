I would like to thank my parents, for dedicating so much of themselves
towards giving me the opportunities that have made writing this
document at all possible. I would like to thank the love of my life,
Kelsey Carroll, for giving me a level of support far beyond what any
man has any right to ask or sense to expect. I would also like to
thank my adviser, Clarence Rowley, and Luigi Martinelli. Both of these
professors have given me endless guidance and technical insight,
without which this thesis would not be possible. Finally, I would like
to thank the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), without whose
constant grant support under the Joint University Program (JUP), this
work would not be possible.
